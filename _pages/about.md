I'm a first year PhD student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes AI4Science, Embodied AI, machine learning, and computer vision.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/) of HMI Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).
